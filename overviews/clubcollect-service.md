# ClubCollect Service

ClubCollect provides a fully-featured service for the collection of invoices, managing the process from start to finish. A typical example consists of a sports club wanting to collect their annual contributions from members. Other examples include a Small to Medium Enterprise \(SME\) invoicing customers, being used to handle the back office activities of a debt collection agency, or being used for a larger companies debtor department.

### Overview of Service

This can be explained in a high-level overview of the steps involved:

#### 1. Importing Invoice Data

Invoices are imported into the system via an Excel sheet or via the API. This consists of all the information necessary to make up an invoice, including the line items.

#### 2. Configuring Collection Settings

These are collected into an Import Batch which can then be configured with settings which regulate, among other things, preferred modes of communication and collection. \(See Invoice Settings below\)
